# Shear-Foce-and-Bending-Moment-Analyzer-in-Building-Frames
This is a major project on which we are currently working.
Our aim is to develop fully automated application which by itself find the seismic and wind forces acting on buildings and calculate the shear forces and bending moments in the frame of buildings.
the model is created using Python programming language and its relevant libraries like:
# MatplotLib
# Numpy

# Functioning of the programe
The Programe when triggered to run will display a simple user interface as shown below

-->The interface as shown above will require Height, number of storey and number of bay as primary input.


--> After processing the primary input the application requires Forces on Storey, width of Bay as secondary inputs

Now after functioning the logical part the application displays plots of Bending Moment, Shear Strength that are resulted due to dynamic forces acting on the building.
The output is as shown below
